# How to install and load epair

## Directly from GitHub

Since it is on GitHub, installing `epair` in R with the `devtools` package 
is straightforward. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("GLOrozcoM/epair")
library(epair)
```

## After downloading package files

An alternative is to download the epair files on to your computer from GitHub. 
You can download them [here](GLOrozcoM/epair). After navigating to the parent folder of the epair directory, you can use `devtools`. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install("epair")
library(epair)
```
