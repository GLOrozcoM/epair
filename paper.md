# Summary

R users trying to get data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) API may run into 
unexpected difficulties. Getting data requires a knowledge of API's, an aptitude for managing JSON files, understanding
specific parameter codes for desired filtering of data, and knowledge of the range of EPA API services
offered. This package simplifies the process of getting data at each step - from determining 
what services are available, to simple placement of data calls to the EPA API. Researchers looking to use EPA data can skip time and setup intensive steps in their workflow by using this package.


# Statement of need 

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.
