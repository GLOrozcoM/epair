# Summary

R users trying to get data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) API may run into 
unexpected difficulties. Getting data requires a knowledge of APIs, an aptitude for managing JSON files, understanding specific parameter codes for desired filtering of data, and knowledge of the range of EPA API services offered. This package simplifies the process of getting data at each step - from determining what services are available, to simple placement of data calls to the EPA API. Researchers looking to use EPA data can skip time and setup intensive steps in their workflow by using this package.


# Statement of need 

`epair` is an R package that helps facilitate downloading air quality data from the US Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) API [@EPA]. The US EPA records and maintains air quality data from a variety of sources and on various spatial and temporal domains. These data are used by researchers from diverse domains including statistics, environmental sciences, environmental health, climate change, physics, atmospheric sciences, and epidemiology, to name a few. Previously, to download these data, users accessed a drop down menu in an online form and selected a data source, pollutant, time and spatial domains, etc. Recently, the downloading procedure was changed by the EPA to an API where users are now required to build an API call which consists of various components, including a base URL, an end point, authentication code, and potential variables. Building such calls can be fairly complicated and time consuming for those not familiar with the AQS data sources and formats, as well as those not used to working with such APIs.

`epair` was developed to help users download these data directly from R using a framework that beginner R users would be familiar with. It includes interactive features, much like the drop down menu formerly available in the EPA API website, that help users explore what data they need to download and to determine what parameters they need pass to the API to get their data. It thus allows users to document their data download/access process along with their analysis code for improved reproducibility and reliability. `epair` relies heavily on the packages `rvest` and `httr`. It has been used in recent scientific publications modeling ozone concentrations in Connecticut, USA [@Gilani:2020], and is currently being used in other research projects exploring the impact of COVID-19 on air pollution concentrations.

# Example

In this example we replicate acquiring data used in [@Gilani:2020]. For this analysis, they require ozone concentrations in the state of Connecticut from July 6 to August 5, 2016. A potential workflow to getting these data with `epair` is given below. The site at https://epair.netlify.app/ provides an in depth tutorial with more examples on using the package.

### Finding the appropriate parameter codes for data calls

Using RStudio's interactive features, we can determine the proper endpoint by starting with `services$`, and selecting `Sample Data`, folowed by `Filters`, `By State`, and `Endpoint`.

```
> services$`Sample Data`$Filters$`By State`$Endpoint
[1] "sampleData/byState"
```

Note that we need to use the following variables in our API call to get our desired data.

1. bdate = July 6, 2016

2. edate = August 5, 2016

3. state = Connecticut (CT)

4. param = ozone

Here, we may use the `variables` object loaded in with `epair` to determine what format our dates need to be in.

```
> variables[["bdate"]]
[1] "bdate"                                                                                             
[2] "The begin date of the data selection in YYYYMMDD format.  
Only data on or after this date will be returned. 
(Note, for annual data, only the year portion of the bdate and 
edate are used and only whole years of data are returned. 
For example, bdate = 20171231 and edate = 20180101 will return full data 
for 2017 and 2018.)"
[3] "20170101"  
```

Similar output for `variables[["edate"]]` suggests that we may encode the beginning date and ending dates as `20160706` and `20160805` respectively. 

To find the parameter code for CT, we use the listing states service.
```
> endpoint <- services$List$Filters$States$Endpoint
> result <- perform.call(endpoint)
> result$Data
   code    value_represented
1    01              Alabama
2    02               Alaska
3    04              Arizona
4    05             Arkansas
5    06           California
6    08             Colorado
7    09          Connecticut
8    10             Delaware
...
```

Finally, to find the parameter code for ozone, we list the parameter codes associated with AQI Pollutants. 
```
> endpoint <- "list/parametersByClass"
> pc <- "AQI POLLUTANTS"
> result <- perform.call(endpoint, pc)
> result$Data
   code                      value_represented
1 42101                        Carbon monoxide
2 42401                         Sulfur dioxide
3 42602                 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
4 44201                                  Ozone
5 81102                  PM10 Total 0-10um STP
6 88101               PM2.5 - Local Conditions
7 88502 Acceptable PM2.5 AQI & Speciation Mass
```

### Making the data call

To acquire the data, the following lines suffice.
```
> endpoint <- "sampleData/byState"
> vars <- list(state = "09", bdate = "20160706", edate = "20160805", 
               param = "44201")
> result <- perform.call(endpoint, vars)
```

# Similar packages

Another existing package, `aqsr` found at https://github.com/jpkeller/aqsr is similar in aims to `epair`, and we here mention key differences. 

`epair`, like the previous version of the EPA AQS API, provides an interactive interface for helping the user determine what data they need to query even if the user knows little about the AQS system. `epair` does this through a comprehensive `services` object to help the user explore EPA API services from R. For instance, besides just listing all available services using `names(services)`, the user can check a description, available filters, endpoints associated with filters, required and optional variables, and examples. `epair` also offers the `variables` object. It contains helpful descriptions for the user to know more about variables in EPA API. 

`epair` uses only two functions, `perform.call()` and `perform.call.raw()`, to obtain data from the EPA API. The former function provides results in a data frame format while the latter function gives results in JSON format. In each case, the user can use the `services` object to determine the appropriate endpoints and filters to apply to the query. `epair` provides documentation for each function, internal and external, as well as a PDF manual with usage examples for each function.
